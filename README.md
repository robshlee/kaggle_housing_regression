# Ames, Iowa Housing - RegressionÂ¶
In this repo I'll be tackling the infamous Ames Housing Dataset provided by Kaggle, https://www.kaggle.com/c/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data. With the large amount of features available and pretty straight forward challenge of trying to predict sales price, I'll be using several models to see how they fare against each other.

From an internal competition between my peer data science fellows at General Assembly, the best performing model in this notebook placed top 10% on the test set.
